# Butterfly-Species-Communities
Network Analysis and Mining Project 

We aim to use butterfly species network as a case study , 
to classify butterflies by studying their feature 
similarities between different categories of butterfly and 
identify distinct communities or clusters based on their 
morphological characteristics. The dataset consists of 
information about butterfly species, their pairwise 
similarity weights, and target labels indicating the 
species' classification.

According to the previous research on butterfly similarity 
networks, deep learning techniques were used for majority 
of the work. We put into use, network analysis techniques 
in order to perform community detection. We even looked into and made use of InfoMap 
algorithm for community detection. We further used Graph 
Neural Network methods like GCN and GAT for further 
analysis.
